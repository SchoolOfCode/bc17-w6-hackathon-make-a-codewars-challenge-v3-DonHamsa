# Warning
- I Kinda messed up...

- My test gives away the answer because my function is asking for an answer rather than asking you to write a function that gives you an answer using parameters passed in.


- When you think you found the correct answer go to encrypt.js and return your coded answer in index.js

- Dont just return the coded answer ...... without actually trying it

## Getting Started

1. Run `NPM run install` in the terminal 

2. You have two JSON files that have the data required to complete the task. 

3. Use the data to find the **country** with the most  **gold medals**

## Tip 

- You might want to read data from the files. What modules might help you with that.
